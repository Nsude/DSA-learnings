## Note-Worthy Concepts

  <summary>🎁 Storage vs Memory</summary>

  Storage is a computer’s long-term space for keeping data, like your hard drive or SSD.

  Memory (RAM) is temporary space used while the computer is running programs. It stores and processes data actively to avoid delays that would occur if everything had to be read directly from storage.

  When you install an app, it’s saved in storage. When you open it, the app’s data and operations are loaded into memory. The amount and speed of memory largely determine how fast the app can run.

  That's why most memory intensive programs like Davinci Resolve or Adobe After Effects often recommend users to allocate more memory space to the program.

  <summary>🎁 Problem Solving</summary>

  When working on DSA problems, it’s helpful to first break down the problem in plain language, sketch visuals, or outline the formula needed to solve it before writing any code. This step represents the “Algorithm” part of DSA.

  Take recurssion for instance, at its core, recurssion is simply `Factorials (!)`, where:

  ```
  n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) ... * 1;

  OR 

  n! = n * (n - 1)!
  ```

  This same concept applies to recurssion, it simply breaks down a problem into smaller chunks.

  <summary>🎁 Recurssion & Memoisation</summary>

  Recurssion is a method of solving complex problems by creating a function that calls itself thereby breaking down the problem into smaller units until it gets to the smallest unit. The result from each operation is returned in the call stack and hoisted up to the next operation and so on, till it bubbles all the way back to the top.
